To be a Data Scientist, you have to be able to analyze your data and crack complex data problems. Again, it is **data** + **complex data problems**. So the required skills can be summarized as follow
* **Data**: Get, store (structure) and produce data.
Yes, It is
  * Get data from files, databases, web documents or any other data source
  * Structure data in memory as list, tree, graph or any other data structure
  * Publish your results in a data destination
* **Complex data problems**: solve problems, write algorithms, and analyze such algorithms.
  * **Problem Solving:** You have to be aware of the basic methods and techniques for problem-solving techniques.
  * **Algorithms:** Write algorithms and convert them to code by a specific programming language.
  * **Algorithms Analysis:**  Computational Complexity Theory and Computability, in general, provides an estimation for the required resources to solve a given problem and the ability to provide solutions for these problems in an effective manner respectively.
  
On this page, we give you the required courses to be a data scientist. It is assumed that you have the basic skills of a data analyst illustrated [here](https://github.com/aorogat/Data-Science-and-Software-Engineering/tree/master/Data%20Analyst). In other words you finished the following courses `Python Programming`, `Descriptive Statistics`, `Data Cleaning`, `Data Visualization`, `Database Level (1) – SQL - Python/SQL`, `Data Formats XML/JSON/…` and these libraries `Matplotlib`, `Numpy` and `Pandas`. 

## Data
### Get Data
During you are studying the Data Analyst package, you have got the required skills to read data from files and databases. If you need to get your data from web documents, you have to take the following course.
#### 1- Web Scrapping (Optional) [\[Youtube Playlist\]]()
In that course, you will go through the HTML, CSS and JavaScript courses from the Web Designer package without details and learn how to extract data from these web files. 
### Structure the Data
#### 1- Data Structure - Python [\[Youtube Playlist\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL73bE5x5W-ICLzNwt5aAjnstOlqNgtqMJ)
This level is application-oriented in which you will learn the main data structures like `List`, `Tree`, `Graph`, `Map`, `Set`, `Hashtable`, and `others` and how to use them. This level does not include how these data structures built from Arrays and nodes as well as does not include the theoretical illustration of their corresponding operations. 

## Problem Solving (Coding Interview)

## Math
#### 1- Calculas

#### 2- Linear Algebra

#### 3- Probability Theory

#### 4- Optimization


## Data Problems
#### 1- Problem Solving

#### 2- Algorithms and Theoretical Computer Science 
The main reference for this course is the "Building Blocks for Theoretical Computer Science (Version 1.3) Margaret M. Fleck January 1, 2013" book. It is a very good book for undergraduate students to be a start for Theoretical illustration behind the Algorithms.
