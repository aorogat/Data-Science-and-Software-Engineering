# Data Science and Software Engineering
Welcome to the *_Data Science and Software Engineering_* page in which we illustrate the different jobs in these 2 fields of study. Any job is a combination of different skills. 
If you would like to work with a specific job title, you have to have the required skills for that job.
For example, Data Analysts are the persons who collect, clean, visualize data and extract insights from that data to support the decision-makers. To be eligible to do that, they must be prepared to generate programs with a specific programming language to fulfill some statistics and visualization on the data which requires a set of skills.
In this tutorial, you will discover several job titles in the domain of data science and software engineering. While Java programming language is used for the lessons of software engineering, Python programming language is used for the data science courses. All the courses are recorded by an Arabic speaker.
